# Good Practice For Software Developement

### Question 1
Which point(s) were new to you?

#### Ans:-
- **Over-communication is important** – Keeping everyone updated about delays or changes avoids confusion. Group chats help keep the whole team informed.  

- **Requirement Gathering** – Just discussing things isn’t enough; writing them down and getting regular feedback helps avoid misunderstandings.  

- **Blocking Distractions** – I knew distractions were bad, but I never thought of actually using apps to block them (like TimeLimit and Freedom).  

- **Time Tracking** – Using a tool like Boosted can help track time and improve productivity.  

- **Food & Exercise Matter** – Eating well and staying active can improve focus and energy levels.

### Question 2
Which area do you think you need to improve on? What are your ideas to make progress in that area?

#### Ans:-
I want to improve my focus and reduce distractions. Here’s how I plan to do it:  

- **Timeboxing** – Set 2-hour deep work sessions in the morning, turn off notifications, and avoid distractions.  
- **Dedicated Workspace** – Work in a specific place free from distractions, like a quiet corner or desk.  
- **Focus Apps** – Use apps like Freedom, Forest, or TimeLimit to block distracting websites.  
- **Mindful Breaks** – Take short breaks for stretching or deep breathing to stay refreshed.  
- **Track My Time** – Use an app like Boosted to see where my time goes and cut down on wasted time.  
- **Better Work Environment** – Keep my workspace clean, well-lit, and free from noise.  
- **Experiment & Adjust** – Try different strategies and improve based on what works best.
