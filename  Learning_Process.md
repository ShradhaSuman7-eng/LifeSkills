## Question 1
What is the Feynman Technique? Explain in 1 line.

## Ans:- 
The Feynman Technique is a four-step method for mastering concepts by explaining them in simple terms, identifying gaps, and refining understanding.

## Question 2
In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?
## Ans:-
The most interesting idea was **focus and diffuse modes of thinking**. **Dali and Edison** used **relaxed states** (holding keys or ball bearings) to let their brains process ideas subconsciously. This shows that learning isn’t just about **constant focus** but also about **stepping away to spark creativity**.

## Question 3
What are active and diffused modes of thinking?
## Ans:-
**Focus Mode:** When you deeply concentrate on a task using familiar ideas, like solving math or reading a book.  

**Diffuse Mode:** When you relax and let your mind wander, helping you get new ideas, like during a walk or before sleeping.  

Using both modes helps you learn better and solve problems.
